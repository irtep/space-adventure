Known bugs:
  Main canvas:
    if you win battle (i won two) and after that you lose battle, game thinks you have won that too.
  Combat:
    Might be still possible that ships get stuck to side
    AI ships might just start to circle
    I think energy points of ships bug.. if other fires, other might lose energy points too
  Merchandise:
   when entering sol (that doesnt have anything to sell), shows stuff from previous outpost
To do
  Missions to all classes:
    Police: destroy Vengeful Wraith or many smaller raiders
    Raider: raid Mars Express or Sword of Justice
    Merchant: make 50 000 sol dollars (with legal goods)
    Smuggler: make 50 000 sol dollars (with illegal goods)
    Freelancer: combination of all above (or something)
  Post-combat:
    If you lose, count the highscore and put you to top lists
    If you win, give you the loot
  Gameplay:
    Rep calculating system
    Sounds and music (i have tracks from Ordos somewhere, should use them..)
    Guns and systems for sale and deploy
    - maybe close combat could be added too... raiding outposts, outposts riding ships in bay. possibility to enter
    disabled ship and fight the crew.
