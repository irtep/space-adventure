Known bugs:
  Main canvas:
    when visiting sol (or any other place that doesnt have anything to sell), there is some sell list still.
    if you win battle (i won two) and after that you lose battle, game thinks you have won that too.
  Combat:
    Might be still possible that ships get stuck to side
    AI ships might just start to circle
  Merchandise:
   when entering sol (that doesnt have anything to sell), shows stuff from previous outpost

To do
